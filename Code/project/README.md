# 🏠 Crime and Hazards tracking Website 🏠

This repository contains the code for a website designed to assist homebuyers and renters in a city to discover a property's crime and hazard profiles. The website provides users with quick and easy access to Crime Safety and Hazard Safety percentile scores for a given address, allowing them to compare it to other properties in the city. Users can choose to continue their search for other properties or dive deeper into the statistics provided on other sections of the website.

## 🚀 Getting Started 🚀

To get started with this project, clone this repository to your local machine. You will need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed in order to run the website locally.

Once you have cloned the repository and installed Python, navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv`. Activate the virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux or `.\venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows.

Next, install all of the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

After the dependencies have been installed, you can start the local development server by running `python manage.py runserver`. This will start the server and open the website in your default browser.
